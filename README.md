# Prisma-CRUD

This project is a prototype of a login system utilizing all abilitiies of CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete). 



One problem I faced was that the index page would not display if you were not logged in to an account. 

# Create
The Create part was the first thing that I worked on in the project. I made a registration form where you would input thing like name password and
birthday. When you then clicked submit it would send the input data to a phpMyAdmin database that I had set up with XAMPP. 



#Read


#Update


#Delete





In this project I learnt to use Node.js, EJS
